# Quake 4 Simple Waveshooter

This is a mod for quake 4 that adds a basic wave shooter mode.

To play, start a new singleplayer game. When the map loads you will be prompted to select a class, once you do yo will be prompted to 'ready up' for the next wave, which will then begin.

To see all of the rest of the features, you just have to kill enemies (to see the different drops per class), collect drops (to get cash) and use the specified keys to buy upgrades.

To activate the berserk ability for the Heavy class, use the L key.
